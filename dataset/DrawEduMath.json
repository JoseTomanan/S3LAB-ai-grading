				"Image Caption": "This is a hand-drawn digital image where the student is trying to draw a number line by hand.

So the student has written 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 from right to left on the left side of zero on the number line, but those numbers don't have a negative sign, but they should have a negative sign on it.

Despite the numbers to the left of zero, 1 through 10, not having a negative sign, you can still follow the student's train of thought. So the student drew an arrow from 0 to negative 6. They write 6, but it should be negative 6 based on its placement on the number line. So they drew an arrow from 0 to negative 6 because that's 0 plus negative 6, which is representing the card that he drew that's negative 6. Then to find the sum of negative 6 plus 12, the student drew an arrow from negative 6 all the way to positive 6 on the right side of 0 to denote that he's doing negative 6 plus 12 equals 6. And then finally, they have an arrow drawn from 6 to the number 2 because that is showing the sum of the last card, which is 6 minus 4 equals 2.",

				"Image Caption": "This is a pre-printed image of student handwriting on it. It's showing a number line that has a minimum of negative 14 and a maximum of 14. Zero is the midpoint of this number line. The interval of this number line is going by one, so only positive and negative integers, whole number integers, are written on this number line. The student has curved arrows, which is what we would call in math hopping. So the student has arrows from negative 6 all the way to 6, and they're hopping from one whole number integer to the next whole number integer, so from negative 6 to negative 5, negative 5 to negative 4, so on and so forth, until they got to 6. And they do this at least a second time, because the curved arrows show that there's another curved arrow on top. However, because there's no extra... All the intervals have two curved arrows on top of them, except for the ones from 0 to 2, and so I can deduce that the student first drew curved arrows hopping from 0 to negative 6, so the student literally hopped 6 spaces to the left to represent negative 6, which is the starting value. And then from negative 6, they hopped right 12 spaces until they got to 6. And then from 6, they hopped left 4 spaces to represent subtracting 4, the card that's negative 4, to land at 2. And I know that they landed at 2 because the interval from 0 to 2 is the only one on this number line that does not have a second line on top of it. There are number lines, additional number lines, in this image that's not related to the problem.",

				"Image Caption": "This is a hand-drawn image on lined paper. So the student is trying to figure out what is the distance between numbers right now. And so the two numbers that they need to find a distance between are 7 and negative 17. And so the student is writing an equation to find the answer of 7 minus negative 7 equals 24 because when you subtract a negative number, you actually add that number. And so they changed it to 7 plus 17 equals 24. The student also drew a vertical number line to check their work. And so the vertical number line has a max of 20 and a minimum of 20. The number line has zero at the midpoint. And between zero and 20, they wrote the number 10. And between zero and negative 20, they wrote the number 10. Unfortunately, the number that's, the number 10 that they drew between zero and negative 20 should actually have a negative sign on it. Because based on the placement of this on the number line, it should be a negative 10. The student drew the placement of negative 17 on the number line, which they put slightly above negative 20. Oh, and additionally, where the student put the number negative 20 on this number line, even though it's below zero, to denote that it's in the negatives, they also forgot to put the negative sign on 20. The student then uses arrows to show the distance between numbers. So they're basically doing the distance, they're basically finding the absolute value of all the numbers. So for seven, the absolute value of seven is seven, because positive seven is seven spots away from zero, and which is what the student is showing by drawing an arrow that starts at seven and ends at zero. That's the absolute value of zero. And then the student drew a second arrow representing the absolute value of negative 17, because that's 17 spaces away from zero. And that arrow is showing that it starts at zero and then ends at negative 17. And so when you actually add the absolute values of seven and 17, negative 17, you get seven and 17, which is what the student wrote in the equation. And then you get the maximum distance of 24, which is the distance between those two numbers.",

				"Image Caption": "So this student drew a hand-drawn image on lined paper. They used both a number line and an equation to solve their work. The number line they drew has a minimum of negative 20 and a maximum of 20. And then they drew intervals for every one tick mark. So the interval of the number line is actually 1. And in this number line, with the maximum being negative 20 and 20, they have zeros in midpoint. And so what the student does is that they start at the number 7, and then they drew an error from number 7 horizontally right until they ended at negative 17. And then they counted the number of ones between 7 and negative 17, and so they got 24 spaces. So they counted each spot, each one spot between 7 and negative 17 to get 24 spaces. And so the student is not using absolute value to solve the work. They're just directly finding the distance between numbers. Their number line represents an equation of 7 minus negative 17, and they actually wrote that expression in their work below the number line. And when you subtract a number by a negative number, that becomes adding. That's the second term. And so the student wrote 7 plus 17, and they got 24.",
